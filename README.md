## Commit Readerâ„¢

Ever wondered how long you've been glued to your keyboard, ignoring the outside world? This tool reads git commits from your local work or hobby project and lets you know exactly how much time you've spent not touching grass.

### Setup

1. Paste away your Gemini API key into a `.env` file. (Privacy? Never heard of it.)
2. Run the Python file and weigh your limits for the day.

### What does it do?

- Reads your git commits.
- Tells you how long you've been working non-stop on a single repo.
- Makes you feel the existential weight of your coding streak.

Go ahead, run it. The grass will still be there
